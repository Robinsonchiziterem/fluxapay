# Fluxapay

Fluxapay is a payment gateway on the Stellar blockchain that enables merchants to accept crypto payments and get settled in their local fiat currency.

FluxaPay bridges the gap between crypto payments and real-world commerce—making stablecoin payments as easy to integrate as Stripe.

## What Problem does Fluxapay solve?

Despite growing crypto adoption, everyday commerce remains largely fiat-based.

A major pain point is that crypto-native customers are forced to offramp every time they want to pay a merchant. This introduces:

•⁠  ⁠Extra fees from offramping and FX conversions  
•⁠  ⁠Payment delays and failed transactions  
•⁠  ⁠Poor checkout experience for crypto users  
•⁠  ⁠Lost sales for merchants  

At the same time, merchants want to accept crypto without holding volatile assets, managing wallets, or dealing with on-chain complexity.

Fluxapay solves this by enabling *USDC-in → fiat-out* payments with a merchant-friendly experience.

## How FluxaPay Works

1.⁠ ⁠*Merchant Creates a Charge*  
   Merchant creates a payment request via API or Payment Link.

2.⁠ ⁠*Customer Pays in USDC (Stellar)*  
   Customer pays from any supported Stellar wallet.

3.⁠ ⁠*Instant Verification*  
   FluxaPay verifies the payment on-chain and updates the payment status in real-time.

4.⁠ ⁠*Settlement to Merchant (Local Fiat)*  
   FluxaPay converts and settles the value to the merchant’s preferred local currency via bank transfer or supported payout channels.

##  Tech Stack (Planned)
